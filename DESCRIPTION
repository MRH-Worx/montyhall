Description: This package provides functions to simulate the Monty Hall Problem. Users can create games, select doors, reveal goats, and test whether it is better to switch doors or remain with the initial choice. This package allows users to quickly spin up and test new games to analyze the probability and outcomes when variables are changed within the game.
